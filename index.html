title: Our Story
storytitle: We met in college...
storytext:
  - "We both lived in East Campus, a quirky dormitory at MIT. Knight majored in math,
     and was very eager to share his homework solving skills with Denise and her
     friends. Denise was aspiring to study linguistics and introduced him to the
     world of syntax and discourse. We bonded over schoolwork, stories about our
     high school years, and Preston and Child’s Pendergast novels."

  - "We often unwinded with strolls through Newbury Street at night,
     day-dreaming about our futures. We discovered that we shared
     the same passions for the outdoors and exploring other countries
     and cultures."

  - "Our first date was such an adventure! It started out with us being locked
     out of our car. We bused and hiked from Fort Lee to recover the key, only
     to realize that one of us probably should have stayed with the car; it
     was still running!"
storytitle2: "... and fell in love..."
storytext2:
  - "It was the first of our many memorable adventures. From a week-long
     trip to Amsterdam, Netherlands to rising with the tides in Friendship,
     Maine, life together was never dull. But what made it special were the
     little moments in between: the nicknames we call each other, the silly
     gestures and the little projects that we worked on together."

  - "When Knight returned to Boston after he completed his graduate program,
     we were ready to begin a new chapter in our relationship. On top of one of
     our favorite mountains — Penobscot in Acadia National Park,
     Knight proposed to Denise. And we are so happy to announce that we are
     getting married on August 19, 2018!"
