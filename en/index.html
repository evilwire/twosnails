title: Our Story
storytitle: We met in college...
storytext: We lived on the same floor of the same dorm. We started talking because Denise needed help with her math problem sets, and Knight was a math major and was very good at explaining. We spent a lot of time that winter walking around the Charles River and exploring Boston. Knight told Denise that what he really wanted was to hike up mountains, but she was skeptical. They took their first trip to Acadia National Park in Bar Harbor, ME. Denise kind of liked hiking after all.
storytitle2: ... and fell in love...
storytext2: We kept dating and hiking for a while, including several more trips to Acadia. Knight eventually proposed there in October 2017!
